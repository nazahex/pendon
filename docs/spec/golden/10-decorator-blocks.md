§9.1: a **decorator line** above a paragraph decorates it; the line touches the
block it decorates (a blank line between them is allowed too):

@@{.lead, #p1}
A plain decorated paragraph.

§9.1: the same for a code fence — a decorator-looking line *inside* the fence
stays literal text (§4.3), only the line above it decorates:

@@codeBlock{`listing-1`, .src}
```rust
fn main() {}
```

§9.1/§6.1: a decorator line carries the positional groups too — the typed form and
the untyped `@@[…]` spelling, whose slots default to `slug` / `title`:

@@aside[intro]("Aside title"){.lead}
A paragraph decorated by a typed group head.

@@[intro2]("Another title")
A paragraph decorated by the `@@`-only spelling.
